# Kong gateway

This repository represent kong api gateway. Kong is a platform intended to manage and conect multiples services
in scale.


## Api gateway
An API Gateway acts like a doorman or receptionist: it receives client requests and forwards them to the correct service.

In addition to routing, the gateway can also enforce important communication rules between the client and microservicesâ€”such as authentication, logging, rate limiting, caching, and more.

The client doesn't need to know which services exist or where they are; it simply consumes the API through the gateway.

This makes the API Gateway essential for the scalability of microservices-based architectures, as it allows for centralized and standardized configuration of connections between consumers and services.

In short, it acts as a controlled barrier between the consumer and microservices, ensuring security, standardization, and control.
